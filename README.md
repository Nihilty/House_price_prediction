# House_price_prediction
House price prediction model using liner regression.  

A machine learning project made using jupyter notebook to predict the house prices from the data provided from data.csv and the accuracy of the prediction.

The given program implements a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as the price, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft_living, waterfront, view,	condition, yr_built	yr_renovated, street,	city and so on.

The program reads the data from a CSV file and performs data cleaning and preprocessing, such as removing missing values and converting categorical variables to numerical values. Then, it splits the data into training and testing sets and trains a linear regression model on the training set.

Finally, the program evaluates the performance of the trained model on the testing set using root mean squared error and R2 score metrics, and outputs the results. The mean squared error represents the average squared difference between the actual house prices and the predicted house prices, while the R2 score represents the proportion of variance in the target variable that is explained by the independent variables used in the model.

Overall, the program provides a simple example of how to implement a linear regression model in Python using the scikit-learn library to predict house prices based on various features.
